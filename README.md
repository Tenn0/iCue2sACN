# iCue2sACN *WIP*

Corsair iCue Devices are nice, but theres no sACN function for iCue (yet). Since I like controlling all my devices via 1 protocol to sync them all, i decided to make a
custom iCue plugin to solve this. 
Im still working on everything, the code currently just works for my 2 devices (Corsair K55 and Corssair M65 Pro RGB).

For one possible source of sACN, have a look at the ledfx project, which brings leds to live with music: https://ledfx.app/
